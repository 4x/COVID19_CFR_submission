# COVID19_CFR_submission
Repository for all scripts required to replicate the CFR analysis for paper submission.

Note that the pdf in this repository (and on medarxiv) is a *preprint*, the
final paper is currently still in peer review. Hence, exact numbers in the final
paper and within this repository may differ slightly from the preprint, due to
e.g. longer MCMC chains.

All code within this repository is published under the MIT license (see LICENSE file).
